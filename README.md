GUIConnectFour
==============
Jake Tansey
Daniel Zimpfer

This program allows two people to play connect four against eachother.  It keeps track
of the score of the series between the two current players and also the highest number of wins of a series
of all players to have played the game.  It provides options for editing the players' names and colors and 
for clearing the scores of both the series and the all time highest scorers.

Originally our game was to include a computer player option, but we did not implement it.

The ability to change the colors of the game pieces is something we added to this project.

Most of the work was done using pair programming where both teammates were present.  Tansey did the images
for the project and Zimpfer did the gameboard/game playing.

Each team member did 50% of the work.
